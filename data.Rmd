The data were organized in a Google sheet file which can be read directly using the *gsheet* package. Let's create the dataset and name it as `dataws`. 

Let's have a quick look at the dataset.

```{r}
dataws <- gsheet::gsheet2tbl(
  "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P3wzN-nQiSKBjfN9u_MADAAtTpBeyAObzhwVybD5b3w/edit#gid=931758392"
)
dataws

```

As shown below, the dataset is organized in 23 colums and 656 rows. Each row is one replicate of the treatment. 

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(dataws)

```
